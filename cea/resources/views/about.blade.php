<h3>About EPL - PSI System</h3>
<div class="row">
    <p>
        This Pollution Source Inventory (PSI) is a long felt need of the Central Environmental Authority (CEA).  The CEA published its first regulation to control industrial pollution in February 1990 under the provisions of the National Environmental Act (NEA). Since then CEA has been issuing Environmental Protection License (EPL) to Prescribed Activities (industries) that discharge/deposit/emit waste into environment with a view to control environmental pollution.  Even though the CEA has this tool to control environmental pollution from such industries, many complains are received by the CEA daily from the public and observed that there are industries still operated without EPL’s or else industries without compliance with the standards and criteria’s published under the NEA.
PSI is tracking pollution across Sri Lanka and ensuring the CEA has access to information about waste discharge/deposit/emit into environment and use of such information for decision making and appropriate intervention for environmental protection and quality improvement.

    <h4> The desired out comes of the PSI are to;</h4>
    
•	Maintain EPL database to collect all information regarding the waste discharge/ deposit/ emit into environment 
•	Minimize environmental impacts associate with hazardous waste
•	Preparation of PSI guideline for rivers in Sri Lanka

The PSI contains data on high, medium and low polluting industries and their pollution sources with possible effect on the environment. Information about the pollution through the PSI is essential to protect the environment and enhance the environmental quality and assist the government in identifying priorities for environmental decision making.
